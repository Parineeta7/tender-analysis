## Project Overview

You have built a full-stack solution that allows users to upload a tender PDF, extract structured information from it using a Python script, and download the results as an Excel fileâ€”all from a modern React web interface.

## Architecture

```
[User Browser]
    |
    |  (1) Upload PDF
    v
[React Frontend (Vite, React, InformationExtractor.jsx)]
    |
    |  (2) POST /extract-info/ (PDF file)
    v
[FastAPI Backend (main.py, Information.py)]
    |
    |  (3) Process PDF, generate Excel
    v
[FastAPI Backend]

[React Frontend]
    |
    |  (5) Download Excel file

## Backend Setup (FastAPI + Python)

### Python Environment & Dependencies
- **Key packages:** `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pdfminer.six`, `xlsxwriter`, `pandas`
- Install with:
  ```sh
  pip install fastapi uvicorn pdfminer.six xlsxwriter pandas
  ```

### Information Extractor Logic
- The core extraction logic is in `Information.py` (copied to the backend directory).
- The script:
  - Extracts text from PDFs
  - Detects and splits sections
  - Summarizes content
  - Extracts BOQ items and important dates
  - Generates a multi-sheet Excel report
- All interactive Colab/upload/download code was removed for backend use.

### FastAPI Server
- `main.py` exposes a `/extract-info/` endpoint:
  - Accepts a PDF file upload (POST)
  - Runs the `TenderAnalyzer` logic
  - Returns the generated Excel file as a download
- The filename is preserved in the response for a user-friendly download.

### CORS Configuration
- CORS middleware is enabled to allow the React frontend to communicate with the backend:
  ```python
  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

## Frontend Setup (React)

### InformationExtractor Component
- Located at `src/components/Tools/InformationExtractor.jsx`
- Features:
  - File input for PDF
  - Uploads PDF to backend
  - On success, automatically downloads the Excel file using the filename from the backend
  - Shows error and success messages
- Uses the Fetch API to POST the file and handle the response.

### Routing
- In `src/App.jsx`, the following route was added:
  ```jsx
  <Route path="/tools/information-extractor" element={<InformationExtractor />} />
  ```
- This makes the tool accessible at `/tools/information-extractor` in your app.

---

## How It Works (End-to-End)

1. **User visits** `/tools/information-extractor` in the React app.
2. **User uploads** a PDF file.
3. **Frontend sends** the file to the FastAPI backend (`/extract-info/`).
4. **Backend processes** the PDF, generates an Excel report, and responds with the file.
5. **Frontend triggers** an automatic download of the Excel file for the user.

---

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend
```sh
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install  # if not already done
npm run dev
```

### 3. Use the Tool
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/tools/information-extractor`
- Upload a PDF
- Wait for processing
- The Excel file will download automatically when ready

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **NetworkError / CORS:**
  - Ensure backend is running and CORS is enabled.
  - Both frontend and backend should be running on localhost (or update URLs as needed).
- **Uvicorn not found:**
  - Use `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000` instead of `uvicorn ...`.
- **ModuleNotFoundError (google.colab):**
  - All Colab-specific code was removed from `Information.py` for backend use.
- **Excel not downloading:**
  - Check browser pop-up/download settings.
  - Ensure backend returns the correct `Content-Disposition` header.
- **File cleanup:**
  - Temporary files are not auto-deleted. For production, consider cleaning up after download.

---

## Extending the System
- **Security:** Restrict CORS origins in production.
- **UI/UX:** Add progress bars, file type/size validation, or drag-and-drop upload.
- **Backend:** Add authentication, logging, or background processing for large files.
- **Deployment:** Deploy backend (e.g., on Heroku, AWS, etc.) and update frontend API URL accordingly.
